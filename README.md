# Soarkle swaddle
Sparkle swaddle made for my sister when she was pregnant with her first child

Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express, sewable neopixels and steel conductive thread 
on black mesh overlaid with black lace. 

I bought both fabrics in Bangkok and started hand embroidering this piece on the eight 
hour train journey down to visit my friend Bua on his small coconut farm in the South 
of Thailand. I completed the embroidery it on the journey back and wrote the code late 
at night in a dirty, stickily hot youth hostel.

-------------------------------------

I never wrote up this project, but the code is in this repo and you can use this Adafruit
guide to lay out for sewn neopixels in a similar way.
